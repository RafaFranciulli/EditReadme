# Rafael J. F. | My Profile

My relationship with computers was very early. At the age of seven I already had a Commodore 128, the inclination to playing games gradually transformed into a general curiosity about electronics and programming. At the age of nine I took my first programming lessons in the language of that time: Basic. I have always been very curious with electronics and mechanics in general, always trying to fix my own hardware. 

I became a tech consultant to friends, family and acquaintances. At 16 my interest in music sparked and I followed a joint path with the new world of digital recording and virtual effects. At the age of 20, I worked for a multinational in the Customer Service area: Cablevisi√≥n taught me at a young age the inner workings of a big company and how to approach users of all shapes and sizes. From that age and later, I was always in all circles, the designated Technician to solve any Software or Hardware problem that arose.

I worked from 2003 onwards, in a distance education company, for 8 years: "UNSAT". My work got transmitted in digital format to a Latin American network of Universities. This was a result of intense work with both Pre Production and Production of University level classes. I excelled with my client, and teachers' expectations, delivering steadily through the years. 

At age 34, I traveled to Germany and worked for an Art Gallery. I lived there for 2 and a half years and that is how I learned German and German culture.
